# Setup:

The frontend is developed with react the backend uses socket io for client to client communication.
Run server.ts for nodejs server + express for frontend delivery
`node server`
The server will listen on port 3000
If frontend has been build `yarn build` the server uses the express framework to deliver the app build for production.

## React development

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn develop`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn start`

Runs the app as node server in production mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to view it in the browser.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**
